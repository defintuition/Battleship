##Intro to pairing
Pair programming is a great learning technique that you'll encounter again and again throughout your coding journey. 

Pairing is basically the idea of two programmers working together on a single computer. Pairing helps you get better at articulating your thoughts and sharing your ideas with your peers, which is a crucial skill for any programmer. It will also help you catch your errors and ultimately help you produce better, bug-free code, which is why it is used at companies throughout the tech industry.

##Why pair program?
* You will produce better code 
* You will learn more, sharing your ideas with your peers and benefiting from their insights 
* You will become better at articulating your thoughts
* You will enjoy your work more and spend less time frustrated
* You will be better prepared for more complicated software engineering tasks, both in school
and beyond, where collaboration is imperative to success

##How to pair
While pairing, you should have the following two roles:

1. **The Driver:** The driver should type and physically control the computer
2. **The Navigator:** The navigator should instruct the driver on the overall, high-level strategy and direction to take the code. The navigator should also be looking out for mistakes, and should inform the driver.

Be sure to **switch roles every 15-30 minutes**! 

Other tips:
- Talk a lot! Try to talk things out as much as possible
- Pay close attention to the code and try to catch errors as early as possible
- Stick to your roles until the agreed upon switching point; navigator should not be grabbing the keyboard/typing when it is not their role, and vice versa
- Rely on your partner and support your partner. Work together as a team!
