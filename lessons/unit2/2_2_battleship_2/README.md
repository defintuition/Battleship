### Exercise: Human-vs-human

Before continuing on to today's assignment you should commit the prior assignment and create
a new branch for this version:

1. Commit your changes locally, either through XCode or 

```
git commit -a -m "Computer versus human"
```

2. Make sure you're in your 
good/current/latest branch. This is evidenced by your code working. You can also check it
by running and reading the branch it tells you you're on.

```
git status
```

3.  Make a new branch based on your latest called human-vs-human. 

```
git checkout -b human-vs-human
```

4. Build a true human-vs-human version. This requires a lot of thinking
about interface. You will need to keep the state of two boards.
