* [UITextFieldDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uitextfielddelegate)
* [Strings](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-string-cheat-sheet/). We'll be manipulating
Strings and it's **always** good to improve our String library abilities.

# UIControl and Delegation

## Lesson

### Delegation with ```UITextField```

[Today's lesson](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2-TextFields-1) uses ```UITextField``` as our first 
illustration of the  delegation pattern in a ```UIControl```. We've already encountered delegation 
in UITableView Fork the [project](https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2-TextFields-1), and clone 
**your fork** to your laptop.
